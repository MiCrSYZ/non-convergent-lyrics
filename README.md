# non-convergent-lyrics

Lyrics rewritten with deep learning metaphors.

Some relationships converge.  
Others don’t.

## About

This repository contains rewritten song lyrics inspired by concepts from
deep learning and optimization theory.

They are not parodies, and not jokes written for shock value.
They are closer to training logs — documenting convergence, divergence,
overfitting, early stopping, and rational termination.

If you have ever:
- waited for a system to converge,
- tuned hyperparameters a little too long,
- or accepted that some failures are architectural rather than accidental,

you may find these lyrics familiar.

Some problem can be solved by further optimization.

Some are solved by stopping.
